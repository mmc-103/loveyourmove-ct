        <span class="big">Hi <span class="text-primary">Christy</span></span>
        <br><br>
        Thank you very much for taking the time to review this website that I created based off the Love Your Move business card. Right now, it is NOT live and almost unfindable on the internet without the specific URL that you can see in your search bar above.
        <br><br>
        I understand that you own the domain loveyourmove.com. I would like to propose taking this website live under that domain. I would do this on a pro-bono basis for one year in exchange for being able to showcase the work I have done for it on my resume as part of my portfolio. There would be a small cost to cover the hosting services.
        <br><br>
        I think what you can see here looks pretty good, but it is merely a foundation.  Over the course of the next year, I would like to collaborate with you to elevate the site to new heights, enhancing its functionality, content, and overall user experience.  For example, the next steps in this process would be to stylize the website for small screens like cell phones and tablets.
        <br><br>
        I would be more than happy to discuss this proposal with you either over the phone or in-person. Also, please keep in mind that everything in the site is completely customizable, I can modify the existing content and layout to your specifications or create a new version based on your input.
        <br><br>
        Again, thank you so much for taking the time to consider my proposal for loveyourmove.com!

Hi, I hope you don't mind but I tweaked the copy on the blog page. Take it or leave it as you see fit.
