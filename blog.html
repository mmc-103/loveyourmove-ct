        <br><br>
        Thank you very much for taking the time to view this website that I created based on a Love Your Move business card. Right now, it almost unfindable on the internet with out the specific URL that you can see in your search bar above.
        <br><br>
        I made this website as a portfolio project during a web development class that I am taking.  Many students would choose to create something like a personal website for this type of project, but I thought it would be better to work with existing branding.
        <br><br>
        I understand that you own the domain loveyourmove.com and I would like to purpose taking this website live under that domain. I would do this on a pro bono basis for one year in order to be able to showcase the work I have done for it on my resume, but there would be a small cost to cover the hosting services.
        <br><br>
        I think what you can see here looks pretty good, but it is merely a foundation.  Over the course of the next year, I would like to collaborate with you to elevate the site to new heights, enhancing its functionality, content, and overall user experience.  For example, the next steps in this process would be to stylize the website for small screens like cell phones and tablets.
        <br><br>
        I would be more than happy to discuss this proposal with you either over the phone or in-person.  Also, please keep in mind that everything in the site is completely customizable, I can modify the existing content and layout to your specifications or create a new version based on your input.
        <br><br>
        Thanks so much!!!
